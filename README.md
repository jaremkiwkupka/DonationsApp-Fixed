# Donation App

Donation App is fully responsive web application that allows you to give things to those in need.

The user can create an account and then log in and out of the application.

As a logged in user, we can fill out a form that consists of 4 steps and a summary. The form saves the data needed to hand over the items to those in need, such as: what you want to give back, in what quantity, indicate the person in need, as well as the address and date of receipt of the items by the courier.

The website also includes a contact form.
